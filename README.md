# New York City Emissions Intensity Map
##### Notebook by [Mohamad Razkenari](https://www.razkenari.com)

## Introduction

To reduce carbon emissions from buildings, the City of New York enacted [Local Law 97 (LL97)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainablebuildings/ll97/local-law-97.page) in 2019 as a part of the Climate Mobilization Act. This law places carbon caps on most buildings larger than 25,000 square feetâ€”roughly 50,000 residential and commercial properties across NYC. These caps start in 2024 and will become more stringent over time, eventually reducing emissions 80 percent by 2050. This project uses building energy consumption and building characteristics data to calculate the emissions intensity, and compare it with the emissions limit according to building end use classification. Then, maximum penalty for non-compliance is calculated.

>**Project Objective**: Calculate Emissions Intensity for buildings in New York City, and assess their compliance with Local Law 97.
